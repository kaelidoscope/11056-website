## Reflections

### Initial Concerns
<p>Beginning this project, I was already aware that my CSS knowledge had some gaps blind spots. Particularly in regard to styling layouts as I have struggled with some aspects of element positioning in the past. However, I found our week 6 tutorial simplified some of the concepts in a visually helpful way.<br>
Leaning into this, I found it helpful to copy the the `grid-template-area` and code around that.</p>

### The Good

<p> Developing my `html` code was a matter of creating a bare bones template for the HTML basics I could easily copy to the pages of my website. This template contained: 

 - valid code for html documents (head & body tags)
 - a div with the wrapper class to aid with later responsiveness  
 - a header with a nav bar links to the pages of the site (logo -> homepage)
 - a div with the class and role of "main"
 - a footer with site map links, social media links, and a logo that links to the homepage
 
 <p> I used the information and images from the current contour556 website to fill in elements of the html pages. Due to time constraints, there were a few `sections` that I had to leave blank (eg: #citycommisions on the `festival` page. Using the instructions from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-html-to-open-link-in-new-tab/) I learnt how to prevent possible tabnabbing with the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with my `target="_blank"` code for added security measures.</p>
 <p> Other coding hurdles I was proud to conquer were: 
 
 - News page articles redirected to current existin pages
 - Followed along with w3schools [Social media Buttons tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp) and managed to replicate the hover effects
 - Working links to external sites (eg: covid government site, etc) open in a new tab and keep visitors on the site.

 
 ### The Bad
<p> I ran into quite a few problems along the way:

 - I originally used only div tags in the footer, but changed the socials to a `span` to get the desire positioning
 - Struggled with some of the images resizing in css/responsive sites
 - Couldn't quite figure out the correct css coding to center elements 
 - Planned for a responsive navbar but ran out of time
 - Bottom right elements of the footer fail to reposition for mobile viewports.


### LoFi Protyping Sketches

<p> My final project feels vastly different from what I had initially prototyped, especially my mobile design.
